# scheduler
Project that I volunteered for which modified the output of an excel sheet into a more presentable format at the request of the officer in charge of a training squadron.

This JAR was executable and mimicked a physical tracking board in the scheduler's office eliminating redudant work in moving student's progress each day they flew an event.
It also implemented the functionality to indicate which events a student was eligible to be scheduled for, which did not yet exist in any other program.
